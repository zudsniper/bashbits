## ABSTRACT
I find myself often in the situation where I wish I had a script I wrote in the past available easily -- and indeed, not entirely lost to time. The purpose of this repository is to keep this situation from occuring as best as possible. The focus is on `bash` scripts, and UNIX environments, but this is not enforced[^2] and has never been a hard-and-fast rule anyway. 
This project is pretty much entirely self-serving, but perhaps it can help others in some way at some point. If you find yourself using it, let me know. That would be neat. If you want to contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING](#contributing), and thanks!  

#### üìå **Use with care, and at your own risk!** 

## LINKS 
- üîó[`bashrc.zod.tf`](https://bashrc.zod.tf/)  
_a direct link to my `~/.bashrc` file<sub>(always a work in progress)</sub>_
- üîó[`gh.zod.tf/bashbits/raw/master/*`](https://gh.zod.tf/bashbits/raw/master/.bashrc)  
_shorthand to link directly to raw text of any file within this repo._  
> ### Usage Example
> _this runs the addressed script via `/bin/bash` without downloading it to a file._   
 ```sh
curl -sSL https://gh.zod.tf/bashbits/raw/master/{{FILE_NAME}}.sh | /bin/bash
```
> üî∂ **Use With Caution!** Hopefully it's fairly clear, but this could have catastrophic consequences if you haven't evaluated (or, ya know, written yourself) the script you're executings' authenticity and/or contents.   


## VERSIONING  
The versions for these are pretty asynchronous, and certainly NOT AT ALL kept track of. YMMV.  
### üï∑Ô∏è _`v4.0.2`_  

> #### `changelog`
> 
> `v4.0.2` **File Description Formatting & `.zodignore`**
> - added/improved headers for `helpers/env-succ.sh`, `helpers/image-prune.sh`, `.bashrc`, and `.zshrc`
> - added `ignores/.zodignore` as first `.gitignore` template. see file for more info
> 
> ---  
> `v4.0.1` **MacOS & Assorted Scripts**
> - Added `.zshrc` for MacOS `Ventura 13.5.1` (Apple Silicon)<sub>though this was originally developed on Catalina (10.15.7), so...</sub>
> - Added `gitget.sh` to get obtain and install a script from a github url, or author and repo combination using the releases of that repository. ***UNTESTED***, definitely doesn't work.
> - Updates to `.ansi_colors.sh` to add shorthand color variable exports for very common colors `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `BLUE`, and `NC` as a shortcut for `RESET`. 
> - Updated `README.md` to reflect changes, even the file structure diff thing _wow_.
> 
> ---
> `v4.0.0` **Some Housekeeping**
> - `.bashrc` adding planning and some actual additions
> - `.ansi_colors.sh` updating the file to contain actually all the currently referenced colors within... itself. Hopefully.
> - `README.md` Updating
> - Updating the version definition convention which I am now imposing on all scripts I write for standardization purposes
> - Deleted / moved old scripts such as the original locations of `get_nvm.sh`.
> - Moved all scripts (for the most part) into descriptive folders
> - more probably
> ---

 ### üåê General Versioning Convention 
I am now imposing a versioning convention explained as follows. This should be followed wherever possible.   
  
> the second line of all files must contain, eventually, a `v` or `V` followed by a valid major.minor.patch[^1] version string.

## ONE-LINERS  
<sup>üü®‚¨õÔ∏è<i> this section will be removed or refactored in the next minor version!</i> üü®‚¨õÔ∏è</sup>  

_Here are single-line, single-execution, daisychains of_ `bash` _to accomplish something or other._   

<br />  

Install `deb11_base.sh` on a clean install of debian 11.  
> ‚ùó‚ùó **MUST BE RUN AS ROOT** ‚ùó‚ùó  
  
```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zudsniper/bashbits/master/deb11_base.sh -o ~/build.sh; chmod ugo+X ~/build.sh; ./build.sh -r me -pw password -k "ssh-rsa xx"; source ~/.bashrc; settitle "$(hostname -f)";
