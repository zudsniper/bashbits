## LINKS 
- 🔗[`bashrc.zod.tf`](https://bashrc.zod.tf/)  
_a direct link to my `~/.bashrc` file<sub>(always a work in progress)</sub>_
- 🔗[`gh.zod.tf/bashbits/raw/master/*`](https://gh.zod.tf/bashbits/raw/master/.bashrc)  
_shorthand to link directly to raw text of any file within this repo._

## VERSIONING  
The versions for these are pretty asynchronous, and certainly NOT AT ALL kept track of. YMMV.  
### 🕷️ _`v4.0.2`_  

> #### `changelog`
> 
> `v4.0.2` **File Description Formatting & `.zodignore`**
> - added/improved headers for `helpers/env-succ.sh`, `helpers/image-prune.sh`, `.bashrc`, and `.zshrc`
> - added `ignores/.zodignore` as first `.gitignore` template. see file for more info
> 
> ---  
> `v4.0.1` **MacOS & Assorted Scripts**
> - Added `.zshrc` for MacOS `Ventura 13.5.1` (Apple Silicon)<sub>though this was originally developed on Catalina (10.15.7), so...</sub>
> - Added `gitget.sh` to get obtain and install a script from a github url, or author and repo combination using the releases of that repository. ***UNTESTED***, definitely doesn't work.
> - Updates to `.ansi_colors.sh` to add shorthand color variable exports for very common colors `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `BLUE`, and `NC` as a shortcut for `RESET`. 
> - Updated `README.md` to reflect changes, even the file structure diff thing _wow_.
> 
> ---
> `v4.0.0` **Some Housekeeping**
> - `.bashrc` adding planning and some actual additions
> - `.ansi_colors.sh` updating the file to contain actually all the currently referenced colors within... itself. Hopefully.
> - `README.md` Updating
> - Updating the version definition convention which I am now imposing on all scripts I write for standardization purposes
> - Deleted / moved old scripts such as the original locations of `get_nvm.sh`.
> - Moved all scripts (for the most part) into descriptive folders
> - more probably
> ---

 ### 🌐 General Versioning Convention 
I am now imposing a versioning convention explained as follows. This should be followed wherever possible.   
  
> the second line of all files must contain, eventually, a `v` or `V` followed by a valid major.minor.patch[^1] version string.
