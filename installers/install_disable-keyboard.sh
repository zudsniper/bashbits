# ------------------
# by @zudsniper on github
# 
# create and then install a very specific script which utilizes `xinput` to disable the 
# built-in laptop keyboard of a specific laptop being used as a server here 
# 
# TESTED only on DEBIAN 12 (which I hate, should just go back to 11, sound harder than dealing with this)
# DEPENDS on `xinput` so `sudo apt install xinput -y` before you use this, ya hear.
# 
# WARNING this creates and installs a systemctl service, then enables it.
